- Do your CI/CD pipelines take forever to run?
- Do your workflows operate consistently across all environments?
- Do you lack proper testing in your pipelines?
- How secret are your secrets?
- Are Docker builds huge and take ages to build?

These are some of the problems we see everyday. Led by our Awarding winning
founder Neil Millard, his expertise will help you and your team with these woes.

With our templated and consistent approach, we can reduce time waiting
for pipelines, reduce errors from running the workflows and assist writing
tests for your code.

When we are finished, you will have optimal, fast CI/CD pipelines, 
automated tests, smoke tests and consistent deployments to all environments.

Together with knowledge sharing and documentation, your team will be enriched
and feel more empowered.

We are guided by Neil Millard's Four Steps:

Step one: **Application designed for cloud**

Step two: **Automated infrastructure for your build, test,
deployment and operation**

Step three: **Scaling for flexible workloads**

Step four: **Keeping the data safe**
