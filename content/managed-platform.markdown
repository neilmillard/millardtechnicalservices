Built to fail is a paradigm you must adopt. Google and
Amazon build their own servers as cheaply as possible
knowing that even if they used name brand servers,
[components fail at least 4% during the first year
](https://www.statista.com/statistics/430769/annual-failure-rates-of-servers/) – and
this increases as the server and components get older.
If you’re going to get a failure anyway, why not save
money and design around the failure.

With our managed platform, failures are monitored and auto recovery
triggered automatically.

Automatic deployments and scaling can also be designed into your
platform enabling your creative teams to do what they do best.

We always design platforms base on these four principles.

Our Four Steps for a successful cloud adoption

Step one: **Application designed for cloud**

Step two: **Automated infrastructure for your build, test,
deployment and operation**

Step three: **Scaling for flexible workloads**

Step four: **Keeping the data safe**
