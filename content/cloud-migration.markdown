You may have heard about the success of start-ups
moving fast and using the best of cloud technologies.
Then why, you wonder, when you move away from
one monolithic application to the cloud, do you see
your downtime figure moving in the wrong direction?

While moving to the cloud means you no longer need
a dedicated team of engineers for security updates, feature
updates and bug fixes, it could lead to a sprawling
mess of servers with data everywhere. How do you
keep your cloud servers manageable and your data
safe?

There are already tried-and-tested methods to migrate, re-platform
and move towards customer-first, mobile-first and cloud-first
applications – where you will save
time, money and energy – and most important of all,
keep the service running with little downtime and
unsociable call-outs.

By using DevOps practices which blend the creation,
testing and rigour of programming best practices,
together with the practicalities of building and operating
enterprise infrastructure environments, we build
a cloud-first, Agile system. By utilising open source
software with a plan, we create great results!
