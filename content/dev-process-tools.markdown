From designing the server infrastructure to monitoring the deployed applications
we use a variety of tools to help us and your team work effectively.

Each step is a building block to create your platform. Packer to build the server images,
Terraform to create the networks and servers, Puppet to deploy applications
and Sensu or Cloudwatch to monitor for failures.

Automation and scheduling from Jenkins, together with our custom Python code
enables the platform to serve you, your teams and your customers.
